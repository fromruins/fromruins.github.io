    <h2><a href="/the-importance-of-morning-rituals">The Importance of Morning Rituals</a></h2>
    <p>The number one piece of advice I would give to anyone that is unhappy with their life is simple: go to bed early, wake up early, establish a productive morning ritual.</p>

<p>How you start your day determines how the rest of your day will go.</p>

<p>If you start your day in a low energy fashion – waking up late, putting on a pot of coffee, slowly getting ready, sitting on the couch and scrolling through your phone until the coffee kicks in, then forcing yourself out the door to get to work or school – your entire day will be low energy and you probably won’t get everything done that you wanted to.</p>

<p>It’s all about momentum.</p>

    <h2><a href="/dear-16-year-old-me">Dear 16-Year-Old Me</a></h2>
    <p>Dear 16 year old Drew,</p>

<p>I am writing to you now, as a 21 year old, to advise you and let you know what to spend your time on, what to not waste your time on, and mistakes that you should avoid.</p>

<p>A lot will change in the next five years, as you are soon to find out. You’ll fall in what you think is love, and get what you think is heartbroken. You’ll make new friends, lose old friends, and then lose your new friends. You’ll move out of your parents’ house at 18 and live on your own, which is more challenging than  you anticipated. You’ll waste a lot of time and a lot of money on things you shouldn’t have spent any time or money on. You’ll learn a lot, lose a lot, and discover a lot about yourself in the next five years that will fly by.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the most important things first, shall we?</p>

    <h2><a href="/the-4-es-of-anxiety-ego-experience-ethics-and-exercise">The Four E's of Anxiety</a></h2>
    <p>One of the most prevalent “mental illnesses” with millennials is anxiety., which is not surprising considering our modern culture has destroyed the family and community, alienated everyone behind digital screens, and convinced people that nothing is their fault and anything can be fixed with a pill.</p>

<p>There’s a reason the pharmaceutical industry is the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-28212223">most profitable industry in the world</a>.</p>

    <h2><a href="/on-moral-ambivalence">On Moral Ambivalence</a></h2>
    <p>Ambivalence | <em>noun</em> | am·biv·a·lence | \am-ˈbi-və-lən(t)s\</p>

<p>1:  simultaneous and contradictory attitudes or feelings (as attraction and repulsion) toward an object, person, or action.</p>

<p>2a :  continual fluctuation (as between one thing and its opposite)b :  uncertainty as to which approach to follow.</p>

<hr />

<p>Every single person living on this planet experiences some form of ambivalence between their inner self and their outer world. A disconnect between what they believe and what they do.</p>

<p>This disconnect between character and personality – between values and actions – causes myriad of emotional issues within oneself. Knowing deep down that what they are doing is wrong yet continuing to do what they’re doing – whether it be out of peer pressure, out of bad habit, or out of fear of change – causes people to question their very existence.</p>

    <h2><a href="/three-steps-to-becoming-a-new-me-analyze-arrange-act">Three Steps to Becoming a "New Me"</a></h2>
    <p>It’s a new year, a new blog, and a new reason to procrastinate doing what’s important (like how I put off writing this post for 3 days.)</p>

<p><img src="http://i0.wp.com/www.fromruins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/print-12.jpg" alt="Iceland" />
<em>Iceland.</em></p>

<p>You go to bed at night worrying about what you need to get done the next day and tell yourself “tomorrow will be the day I finally start to get my shit together.” You wake up the next morning and fall back into the same bad habits that have only weighed you down. You know what you want out of life, you know what you need to get it, but you still take the easiest route and do what’s comfortable. It’s not productive, it’s not helping you – but it’s easy… it’s safe. I’m not going to pretend like I don’t have bad habits and procrastinate, I do. I waste time goofing off on the internet, waste time playing video games, waste time drinking, waste time watching Netflix.</p>
